# Wide Open Thoughts

Experimental unfinished code. (if you find good DNN for CIFAR-10 dataset with this framework - test accuracy over 90%, feel free to do pull request - it would be appreciated :). It works great on MNIST... as an example for you)

| DataSet  | DNN | Test Accuracy |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)  | DNN_MNIST_01.py | >99% |
| [ADS](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)  | DNN_ADS_01.py  | ~85%|
| [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)  | ?  | ?|
